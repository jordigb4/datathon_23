# datathon_23

## Inspiration
We have done this challenge because we wanted to work with data that can have a real impact and close to us, the transport we use to reach university.

## What does it do
The project extracts relevant data statistics, extracts maps and visualizations, and allows to find conclusions to improve transport.

## How we built it
We have used Python with several libraries for visualization and data processing.

## What obstacles we have encountered
The database has required a large amount of preprocessing, and offered a large branching, so it was necessary to decide what to focus on.

## Which things we are most proud of
We have obtained information that allows us to infer important data on how students move, and very good visual representations.
